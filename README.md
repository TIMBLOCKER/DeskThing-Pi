# DeskThing-Pi 

### What brought us here?
Some days ago I was stumbling upon a wonderful project by the very talented [ItsRiprod](https://github.com/ItsRiprod) who tried to save the ever doomed Spotify CarThing from becoming total E-Waste. Unfortunately the opposite seemed to be happening. Everyone now wants to have an EOL CarThing to be able to run DeskThing on it.

Rather than trying to get my hands on one of these, I wanted to get it running on my Raspberry Pi 4. So this is the official Repo of DeskThing-Pi.

## Want to get started?⚙️
#### Prequisities
As this project is still in a really early stage, I can only confirm that things are working with the current checked hardware. So you need to have some setup already done to be able to start:

##### Mandatory
 - Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4 (I use the 4GB  Version but others should work as well)
 - Standard Raspberry Pi OS (64 Bit) freshly installed (I prefer to use the Raspberry Pi Imager to flash the OS)
> Attention 

##### Useful but not entriely necessary

 - SSH enabled
 - local Hostname set to something you remember (e.g. `raspberrypi.local`)
 - WIFI enabled and already provided with SSID and Password
 - Language Settings correctly set
 - Configured User with known Password

#### Installing DeskThingPI
##### Connect to your Pi and run setup
If you've set everything according up correctly you should be able to SSH into your Pi with the aforementioned User and Password combination. You can then just copy the Link into your command line and execute the command:

    sudo bash -c  "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIMBLOCKER/DeskThing-Pi/refs/heads/main/deskthing-pi-installer.sh)"

##### Setup Permissions to run DeskThingServer
Because RaspberryPi OS is a Linux derivative we now need to set up the permission structure of the Pi to be able to recognize the installed dependencies. This can be done by executing the following two commands:

    sudo  chmod  777  -R  node_modules
and

    sudo  chmod  777  -R  DeskThing

#### Starting DeskThingServer

Now you have everything to get started. With the command: ``npm run dev --host`` in your ``~/DeskThing/DeskThingServer/`` directory you can start the server and install your Apps as needed.

> Attention: Here it is essential that you have installed the GUI Version of Raspbian because otherwise you wil get some errors with the build pipeline of DeskThingServer.

#### Starting DeskThingClient
After the Server successfully started you can install the client via the Server App. When the install process is finished you can easily start you DeskThingPi by typing:
``DISPLAY=:0.0 chromium-browser --noerrdialogs --incognito --kiosk http://localhost:8891/`` in your command line. This will open the DeskThingPi in Kioskmode.

> Attention: You can always exit the Kiosk Mode and go back to the DeskThingServer Settings by pressing ``ALT`` and ``SPACE`` on the keyboard.

## Current Limitations 
In the folowing I will experiment with off the shelve touch displays so that we can create a list of known-good parts für the DeskThingPi. The final Goal is to eliminate the need of the CarThing-Hardware and make it so that people can easyly install the project themselves.

Regarding this topic, all help is appreciated. Just DM me on DeskThings Discord.
